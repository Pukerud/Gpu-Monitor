My first project is a GPU-Monitor.

REQUIREMENTS:
.Net Desktop Runtime - Will ask for this when you start the Program.
It uses nvidia-smi so it is only for NVIDIA cards and Drivers must have been installed.

Settings is stored in the registry
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GPUMonitor

Start Check - Starts the GPU check. 
Uses the settings you provide in the Settings Dialog.


Stop Check - What do you think? its Stops the check..
Test Mail - Test mail sending with the settings you provide in the Settings dialog.


Rndr Log - Not Implemented yet (Going to create a Google Spreadsheet, with a Sheet that has the computer name where it is running.)
